#### LeaderBoard Note
- LeaderBoard feature is still connected to my rented cloud server so it may fail down. But this function will not affect the basic gameplay.
- If you want to fix/implement the LeaderBoard, you should have a server installing a database to get data and return data to the game.
- My solution is rent a could server, install nginx, mysql, php and relevant dependency, then write 2 php scripts, one is to receive data and write data into mysql, one is read data from mysql and return to the game request. Then change the url in Asset/Trivia 365/Script/Controller.cs (search for "http://").
